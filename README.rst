ISM Summer School Project: Rotation Curves
==========================================

This is code that I am writing to take part in a hands-on project at the 2021 International Summer School on the Interstellar Medium of Galaxies, from the Epoch of Reionisation to the Milky Way.  The school is being held virtually via Zoom, and consists of both lectures and hands-on projects.

In this project, we (try to) fit rotation curves to galaxies with CO(2-1), HI and FIR data.
