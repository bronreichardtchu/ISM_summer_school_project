ISM Summer School Project: Rotation Curves
==========================================

This is code that I wrote to take part in a hands-on project at the 2021 International Summer School on the Interstellar Medium of Galaxies, from the Epoch of Reionisation to the Milky Way.  The school was held virtually via Zoom, and consisted of both lectures and hands-on projects.

In this project, we fit rotation curves to galaxies with CO(2-1), HI and FIR data.
